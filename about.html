<p class="box1">A full plate of food filled with the goodness of nutrients is nourishing, gives one strength; both bodily and mental, keeps one active and free from diseases. One of the most important aspect for any kind of development is taking care of children, enabling them to grow up healthy. But the prevailing situation in India speaks otherwise, we have constantly failed to provide the most basic care to our children, providing healthy meals to them which results in stunted growth, malnourishment etc.
An intervention at the right time, like educating one generation or providing livelihood to increase income can help families break the cycle of generational poverty.
India is population rich.Our people are our resources and if each one of us commits to giving regularly,we will be strong enough to solve our problems.
We could even be audacious enough to say that we as a community may not need any aid if we make  giving a way of life.</p>
